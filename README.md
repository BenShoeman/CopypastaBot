# Copypasta Bot

What the f*ck did you just say about me? I'll have you know that this is a bot
designed to generate copypasta learned from existing copypasta using a
second-order Markov model!

## Prerequisites

You will need to install the following packages through pip or other means:

```
beautifulsoup4
pillow
```

## Credits

Shoutouts to:

- [Louis Abraham](https://github.com/louisabraham/copypasta-data) for
  the copypasta scraped from various resources. I was feeling too lazy to write a
  scraper myself and so it was very helpful :)
- [deekayen](https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741) for the text file
  containing the 1000 most common words in English
